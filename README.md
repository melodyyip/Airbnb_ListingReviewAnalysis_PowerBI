# airbnb_ListingReviewAnalysis_powerBI

I came across Airbnb free datasets and I found it looked interesting to work with. I conducted an exploratory data analysis including three dimensions: Business Performance, Customer Satisfaction, and Host Growth. Surprisingly, Mexico city has a high customer engagement, and satisfaction contributes to better value for travels. 

‚ú®Takeaway‚ú® from the visualization: 
- High demand for travel drives up prices üöÄ in October before the year-end rush in December and January. Prices and demand drop„ÄΩÔ∏è dramatically in April-May, during most school terms.
- Among 10 major cities, Mexico City is the most loved cities by Airbnb users. It provides the best value for money at 9.5/10 value ratings and 95% overall ratings with lower Room Price.
- The most important featuresüß≥affecting the overall score are Wi-fi, the Essentials, long-term stays allowed and kitchen. 
- The host in Mexico City also offers the quickest Host Response Time. A notable 40% majority of Super Hosts are here! ü•á
